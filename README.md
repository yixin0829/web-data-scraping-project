# web_data_scraping_project
A project idea developed during the winter break to use python for scraping environmental data from a website and then create visualizations. The final result is to be displayed on a self-created webpage.

## Research & Workflow
A majority of the information and workflow applied in the project can be found from [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-with-python-a-to-copy-z-277a445d64c7)
