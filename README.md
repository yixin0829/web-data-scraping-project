# web_data_scraping_project
A project idea developed during the winter break to use python for scraping environmental data from a website and then create visualizations. The final result is to be displayed on a self-created webpage.

## Research & Workflow
A majority of the information and workflow applied in the project can be found from [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-with-python-a-to-copy-z-277a445d64c7)

### Workflow

- [x] Pick a website 
- [x] Web scraping
- [x] Store data into two .csv files (can be found in doc)
- [x] Calling Gender API to enrich the data
- [x] Generate basic charts using matplotlib, nltk
- [x] Create mysql database / (Firebox) and store the data

## Needed Tools
1. Python 3 (bs4, requset, matplotlib, nltk, FLask)
2. MySQL
3. Gender API

## Result
Please see the data scrapped stored in the **data_title_author.csv and key_words.csv**

Along with **genders.csv** for predicted gender (data enrichment)

Some plots can be found under /plots.
